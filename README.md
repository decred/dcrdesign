**/dcrdesign** helps with practices, coordination, maintaince, accessibility and scaling of Decred projects design outputs. DCR design domain consists of `ux/ui`, `identity`, and `visual communications` sub-domains. This repo's functions are following: 

- Communicating DCR design contributors current tasks and forming high level overviews (using Gh’s built-in pm features). 
- Coordinating work and syncing up with designers, developers and other contributors. 
- Posting deliverables and reports for archiving. 
- Providing a central location for cross-referencing design related issues or questions through-out the ecosystem.
- Accepting and reviewing requests.

### Use Practice: 
- Use Matrix #design and projects ops channels for quick and temporary communications and general discussions around work. (#design /#_ops)
- Individual contributors also often use other means like telegram for regular comms.
- Post tasks and projects for coordination on the relevant `project boards`
- New items should be started by posting `Issue` (or `Note` on relevant `project board` if this is used). 
- When doing confidential work, post the published result into the `Completed board` and document it within an `issue` (e.g. short delivery report, preview, links, work files or assets).
- Post delivery reports, assets and other references as `comments` within `issues`. 
- Use `labels` to improve organisation between `issues`.

If you are working on visual, motion design or illustration tasks for general visual communication (e.g. promotion, marketing, instructions…) – using only /dcrdesign repo and Matrix will cover most of the productivity needs.

If you are working on UI/UX side of different Decred products and platforms – the relevant products repositories and /dcrdesign should be regularily used and cross-referenced to keep all parties in sync. While different product repos have various use practices, levels organisation and activity, the /dcrdesign's is to bridge gaps between design practices and progress, and it's appliances across the products and development. 

Typically issues to product repos, ie. new implementations, should be kept short and concise, and broken up into well mangable parts if needed - the issues in /dcrdesign should be for tracking progress, covering extensive details and archiving, thus can be larger in size. As a rule of thumb, needless double posting should be avoided though.
