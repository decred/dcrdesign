Narrative Outline:
General Premise:
Over the years the Decred community has responded well to characterisation of Stakey for different purposes.  There is also a requirement to create a differentiation between the initial on-boarding experience and Stakey’s PoS Onboarding Experience so not to muddy the water between them.


Stakey breaks down barriers to entry.  Let's take advantage of that.


The general premise would be that throughout would be that Stakey could take on a kind of “Mr Ben” type character who takes on different personas in order to convey a given point.  This grounds the experience to a particular look however it does come with some creative trade-offs.

It is worth noting that the visuals are complementary to the text and should be used to support points raised instead of completely supplement them.


In this sense another influence would be the likes of tongue in cheek TV Gameshow Catchphrase.


https://youtu.be/9MWs0HchNPo 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase_(British_game_show) 


The show visualised commonly used catchphrases creating an inclusive and popular gameshow.


Stakey (being a stylised cartoon creation) lends well to the two influences above and plays well into prior caricatures that have been created in the past by lustosa for staking onboarding as well as special events.
Format:
All stakey’s a looped self contained pieces, no longer than 5-8 seconds.  


Creating in this way allows more flexibility on the implementation side.  As the user progresses through a section new animations could be introduced to support stated copy.


This may not cover every situation however and there will be edgecases that defy a character centric convention.


There is an opportunity to create a number of new illustrations to aid staking on-boarding based using a combination of new concept previously produced pieces.  These new narratives have been split into 4 sections below. 
Introduction:
Narrative Overview:


Description: 
There is currently no copy for this section however it would make sense to introduce the character prior to exploring the following sections.

Narrative Overview:
In 2018 Marcelo Lustosa produced a set of stakey characters representing various states of the ticket: https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/51


This was a great premise that was well-received by the community.  There are numerous persona’s used in the prior section that are applicable / borrowed from the initial sketches.
